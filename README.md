### Hi there. ðŸ‘‹ My name's not important. Like many of you on GitHub, I'm learning Git and its fundamental basics. Also, ignore the "PRO" tag on my profile because I'm not a pro. :grinning:


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for new job opportunities in the Software development industry.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MERN stack.
- Here's how to reach out to me (just ignore this already): 
- ðŸ“« Twitter: https://twitter.com/MoodaG1998 
- ðŸ“« LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hassan-mahmood-buic-fall2018/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a bad habit of procrastinating a lot. More than any normal human being. :grinning:
